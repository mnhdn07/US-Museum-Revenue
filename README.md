## Hello Everyone!
In this project, I wanted to get a better understanding of some of the most popular types of museums and how much revenue they bring in. I primarily used SQL to query the data and Tableau to visualize the dataset. I had a few questions about some of the data that I wanted to represent and how I could determine which museums and states generated the highest amount of revenue. 

## Some questions I had from the data
1. How much revenue do museums bring in?
2. What are the most popular museum types?
3. Which states generate the most revenue?


## 1. How much revenue do museums bring in?

As you can see, museums generate almost 10 billion dollars from ticket sales and donations from various organizations. Art museums tend to bring in the most revenue while children museums bring in the least. Art museums seem to hold almost 1/3rd of the amount of total revenue from all of them museums. There are over 7000 museums spread across the United States.

## 2. What are the most popular museum types?

Based off this pie chart, historic preservation museums cover well over 50% of the amount of total museums. For each museum in the United States at least 1 out of 2 museums would be classified as a history preservation museum. Although historic preseveration museums are mostly prevelent, the only account for about 300 million dollars worth of revenue. Meanwhile, there are 330 art museums that generate 10 times as much revenue despite being less common. We can conclude that art museums are among some of the most popular museums because of funding and ticket sales. Also, general museums are the 2nd most prevelent museums in America and also hold the 2nd number in revenue which coorelate to their popularity.

## 3. Which states generate the most revenue?

The state that generated the most amount of revenue is Washington DC, which is classified as a government district rather than a state. Suprisingly, the Smithsonian Instituion you see on the map generated approximately 1.3 billion dollars in revenue which is about 10% of total revenue spread out between all museums. It accounted for most of the revenue in Washington DC. Kentucky followed 2nd and Illinois followed 3rd for the most revenue.
